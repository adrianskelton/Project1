## User stories

The content will not change too much so the user experience goals for the first time visitor to returning visitor are essentially the same. These goals are primarily:

### Entice the user to want to book
All your files and folders are presented as a tree in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the tree.

### Make booking and communication easy
You can rename the current file by clicking the file name in the navigation bar or by clicking the **Rename** button in the file explorer.

### Make the above equally user friendly on all available devices
By using appropriate media queries to adjust the website to all screen sizes and using flexbox to adapt wider screeen content down to smaller sized content better suited to columns instead of row layout.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/MVYH268/pallete.png" alt="pallete" border="0"></a>

The choice of my color scheme was inspired by the nature sorounding this airbnb so it was earthy and green, but also using the colors in the logo of the website, namely the green and orangy red of the aloe plant in the logo. 

### Typography

I went for a google font Lato because it looked clean and modern and was easy to setup. Below is a screenshot of the font.

### Imagery

The imagery chosen was to showcase the beauty of the area and to entice potential clients to want to book the accomodation. The images were compressed using website TinyPNG.com to maximise performance.

### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq to design my wireframes.


## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

**Github** - Used for storage of my site and for publishing online.<br>
**Codeanywhere** - The IDE used for editing my site and pushing changes.<br>
**Python** - Used python 3 via terminal to preview my site using a local http server.<br>
**HTML5** - The core of the site was built with HTML version 5.<br>
**CSS** - CSS was used to style the website and define fonts and layout.<br>
**Bootstrap** - Bootsrap was used to align items and create items such as the Navbar, accordion, carosel, flipcards, forms etc.<br>
**Google Maps** - Google maps embed from Google inc.<br>
**Youtube** - Videos embedded from Youtube.<br>
**Font Awesome** - Social Media icons from Font Awesome.<br>
**Google Chrome** - The website was built and tested in google Chrome.<br>
**TinyPNG Website** - Used to compress images so they load faster.<br>


### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

I deployed everything my website onto gitpages.

### Local Development

To clone the repository:

1. Log into your account on github
2. Go to the repository of this project /adrianskelton/Projecto1/
3. Click on the code button, and copy your preferred clone link.
4. Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.
5. Type 'git clone' into the terminal, paste the link you copied in step 3 and press enter.


#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

The navbar I used was from bootstrap.  (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/)
To make the youtube video responsive I found this css code clip (https://yoast.com/how-to-make-youtube-videos-responsive/)

### Content

I wrote all of the content for the website, though I did get some information from mountain magic's website such as how many rooms and bathrooms of each container unit.

### ¬†Media

As my brother owns the container homes this was another reason to use this as my project as it made aquiring the images and video content easy without having to ask for permission from somebody I did not know. Images that were not from my brother was the portrait image for the reviewer on the home page which I get from royalty free website pexels.com
The other 3 images above the footer on the home page are my own.
  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Kenan Wright from code institute who helped me along the way as well as my mentor Narender as well as all the users on slack
