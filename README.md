## Target Audience

The target audience is all tourists travelling through the western cape of south africa that may pass through the wilderness area and are looking to stay over at the airbnb. The uniqueness of the accomodation and the amazing views are a big positive in the ease of selling point. The website is fairly basic with a good review from a past guest, beautiful images, a short desription of each of the accomodation options along with a side scrolling gallery, also there is a clearly visible "book now" image link underneath each gallery. Then there is a contact page with a map, contact form and contact details. An airbnb 

## User stories

The content will not change too much so the user experience goals for the first time visitor to returning visitor are essentially the same. These goals are primarily:

### As a tourist I would like to get a feel of the accomodation
Images throughout the site display a good feel of the sorrounding area as well as the accomodation page which shows the two different accomodation options. The review on the first page also gives a good insight on the kind of experiences that a guest has to entice potential guests to book.

### Make booking and communication easy
On the accomodation page there is are clearly visible book now buttons that link the user to airbnb pages to book the accomodation selected, these also have the correct aria labels so that visually impaired users know which accomodation option they are selecting to book. The contact page has more contact details available as well as a contact us form and a map showing directions to the accomodation.

### Make the above equally user friendly on all available devices
By using appropriate media queries to adjust the website to all screen sizes and using flexbox to adapt wider screeen content down to smaller sized content better suited to columns instead of row layout. I made a media query with a breakpoint for screen sizes below 1000px and tested this on chrome and it seems the best option for the user experience. 

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![alt text](assets/images/pallete.png)<br>

The choice of my color scheme was inspired by the nature sorounding this airbnb so it was earthy and green, but also using the colors in the logo of the website, namely the green and orangy red of the aloe plant in the logo. 

### Typography

I went for a google font Lato because it looked clean and modern and was easy to setup. Below is a screenshot of the font.

### Imagery

The imagery chosen was to showcase the beauty of the area and to entice potential clients to want to book the accomodation. The images were compressed using website TinyPNG.com to maximise performance.

### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq to design my wireframes.


## Features


### General features on each page

### Navbar

I used a navbar from Bootstrap, below are two views of the desktop view and the responsive mobile view that transforms into a hamburger menu.

### Footer with social media icons

I added three social media icons for instagram, facebook and airbnb. They were sourced from font awesome and I changed the color to the same green color chosen in the color pallette previously mentioned.

## Features by page

### Landing page

The Landing page has a short intro of text describing the accomodation and how popular it is based on reviews and via publications. Then we have a review from a past customer with a portait image of her and a youtube video to the side displaying the containers and the area. I then chose 3 very colourful images that showcase the beauty of the area directly below the above content. I feel that the landing page is a great showcase for the containers and entices the user to click to the next pages where they will hopefully book or at least make an enquiry which is the end goal of the website.

![alt text](assets/images/features/landing.png)<br>

### Accomodation page

The accomodation page features the two options for accomodation with an overview of how many rooms and bathroooms available, a short writeup on the accomodation, a horizontal scrollable gallery as well as a book here link below which takes the user to airbnb where they can book. 

<img src="assets/images/features/accomodation.png" alt="pallete" border="0"></a>

### Contact page

The contact page features a google map that was embedded via google maps and a contact form, the thank you message in the popup box after submitting the form is a simple alert javascript function. The third column in the row is just the basic contact details of the bnb's.

<img src="assets/images/features/contact.png" alt="pallete" border="0"></a>

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

I would like to more review which would be changed everytime the landing page is visited.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

**Github** - I used GitHub for the storage of my site and Gitpages to pubish my website
Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).<br>

## Testing

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.



* [Index Page W3C HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Ffoundintranslationsodaci.herokuapp.com%2F) - Pass

### Lighthouse

I used Chrome's Lighthouse developer tool to check my sites performance, it was being slowed down by large images before compression but then faired well after compression. Below are the final results.

### Accessibility tester

I used this to check how my site was rated for its accessibility, this led me to add more aria-labels as well as changing alt descriptions for the book here links as I realised having two buttons that both said "book here" could be more confusing that two seperate descriptions that included which container you were booking.

### Code Used

The navbar I used was from bootstrap.  (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/)
To make the youtube video responsive I found this css code clip (https://yoast.com/how-to-make-youtube-videos-responsive/)
Pop-up Modal used from (https://codepen.io/imprakash/pen/GgNMXO) modified to suit my websites color scheme and style
Photogallery used on accomodation page (https://codepen.io/maxvoltar/pen/eYOPdMG)
Tip used to not target all ul and li tags but only the above photogallery (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49995250/css-global-change-to-all-ul-li-except-specific-id-or-class)

### Content

I wrote all of the content for the website, though I did get some information from mountain magic's website such as how many rooms and bathrooms of each container unit.

### ¬†Media

As my brother owns the container homes this was another reason to use this as my project as it made aquiring the images and video content easy without having to ask for permission from somebody I did not know. Images that were not from my brother was the portrait image for the reviewer on the home page which I get from royalty free website pexels.com (https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-wearing-white-shirt-with-white-flower-on-her-ear-3586798/)
The other 3 images above the footer on the home page are my own.

  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Kenan Wright from code institute who helped me along the way as well as my mentor Narender as well as all the users on slack
